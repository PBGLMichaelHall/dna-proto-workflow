# DNA Snakemake Proto-Workflow

This repository is based on the [Snakemake tutorial](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/welcome.html) and [PaneucalyptShortReads](https://github.com/kdmurray91/PaneucalyptShortReads)

## [Setup](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/setup.html)

An easy way to setup the prerequisites is conda.

**Get the Miniconda Python 3 distribution:**

```
$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

**Create an environment with the required software:**

> NOTE: conda's enviroment name in these examples is `dna-proto`.

```
$ conda env create --name dna-proto --file envs/condaenv.yml
```

**Activate the environment:**

```
$ conda activate dna-proto
```

## Reproduce results

Clone the repository onto your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/warthmann/dna-proto-workflow.git
```
Check the new directory
```
cd dna-proto-workflow
ls
```

> NOTE: the ```output``` directory and some files in the ```metadata``` directory are generated by the workflow.

### Visualising the workflow
You can check the workflow in graphical form by printing the so-called DAG.

```
snakemake --dag -npr -j -1 | dot -Tsvg > dag.svg
eog dag.svg
```

### Pretending a run of the workflow

```
snakemake  -npr
```
### Check config and metadata

We provide scripts to list metadata and configuration parameters in ```utils/```.

```
python utils/check_metadata.py
python utils/check_config.py
```

<br>


### Data

Main directory content:

```
.
├── config.yml
├── envs
├── genomes_and_annotations
├── metadata
├── output
├── rules
├── scripts
├── Snakefile
├── snpEff.config
├── utils
├── ...
```

You will need to configure the workflow for your specific project. For details see the documentation.
Below files and directories will need editing:

- **Snakefile**
- **genomes_and_annotations**
- **metadata**
- **config.yml**
- **snpEff.config**

You can download example data for testing the workflow. [click here to download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kpJsghU-jNTSKC9uEB9khos390lZNROr?usp=sharing)

## How to contribute

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/raw/master/assets/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account (not in your computer).


### Clone the repository

<br>

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/yVWsByF/Screenshot-from-2019-12-18-10-38-25.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now **clone the forked repository** to your machine.
Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon. The url is going to be like: ```https://github.com/your-username/dna-proto-workflow.git``` where `your-username` is your GitHub username.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dna-proto-workflow.git
```

Once you've cloned your fork, you can edit your local copy. However, if you want to contribute, you'll need to create a new branch as follows.

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):
> NOTE: you can't change the name of the directory.

```
cd dna-proto-workflow
```

You can check your branches and active branch, using the ```git branch``` command.
```
git branch -a
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

For example:
```
git checkout -b development
```

From this point, you are in the new branch and edits only affect your branch.

If things go wrong, simply remove your branch using
```
git branch -d name-of-the-branch.
```

Or revert back to the `master`-branch using
```
git checkout master.
```

### Make changes and commit

Once you've modified something, you can confirm that there are changes with `git status` (called from the top-level directory).
Add those changes to your branch with `git add`:

```
git status
git add .
or
git add name_of_the_file_you_modified
```

Commit those changes with `git commit`:
```
git commit -m "write a message"
```

### Push changes to GitHub

Push the changes in your local copy (on your machine) to your remote repository on Github with `git push`:
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```
replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier (e.g., `development`).


### Contributing to the project: Submit your changes for review

In your repository on GitHub, klick the `Compare & pull request` button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://i.ibb.co/N7np2Ch/compare-and-pull.png" />

Now submit the pull request and you'll see something like:

<img style="float: right;" src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-review-edit-branch.png" alt="submit pull request" />

We'll get notified and can check your changes and merge them into this project (in general, into the `master` branch).
